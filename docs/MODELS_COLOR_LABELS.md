Model Colour + Label System

KForge uses a simple colour-based labelling system to help users quickly understand the expected cost, risk, and usage profile of a model.

These labels are designed for human decision-making, not billing precision.

🔴 Paid — Heavy       High-cost paid models  Complex / critical tasks
⚪ Unknown            Pricing unclear        Use with caution

Important Notes:

These labels are informational only

Billing, limits, and availability are determined by the provider

Users assign labels manually per model

Labels describe expected usage patterns, not guarantees
