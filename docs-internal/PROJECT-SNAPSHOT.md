# 🧭 KForge — PROJECT SNAPSHOT (Internal Canonical State)

**Last Updated:** February 22nd, 2026
**Phase:** 4.2i — Single-Surface GPT UI + Full Focus Mode
**Status:** Architecturally Stable

This file is the authoritative operational reference.

If anything conflicts with:

* chat memory
* assumptions
* scattered notes

This file wins.

Not user-facing.

# 🟠 1️⃣ Project Overview

KForge is a desktop-first developer workspace built around:

• A GPT-clean AI surface
• Secure filesystem access
• Explicit, consent-gated tooling
• Calm, attention-disciplined UI

KForge is **chat-first**, not tool-first.

---

# 🟣 2️⃣ Current Architectural Reality (Phase 4.2i)

## 🧠 Execution Authority

AI execution lives in:

src/App.js

This file owns:

• Canonical message state
• AI request building
• Context injection
• Patch instruction injection
• Retry logic
• Project lifecycle control
• TranscriptBubble definition

If AI behaves incorrectly → start here.

---

## 💬 Single Message Store (Critical Rule)

There is exactly one message array:

messages (owned by App.js)

Everything renders from this.

Structure:
id, role, content, ts, optional action metadata

No duplicate message systems exist.

---

## 🧩 Rendering Surfaces

There are two projections of the same message store:

### Chat View (GPT-clean)

File: src/ai/panel/AiPanel.jsx

• Assistant-only projection
• Clean reasoning surface
• No tool/system noise
• Used in both Focus ON and Focus OFF

### Transcript View

File: src/ai/panel/TranscriptPanel.jsx

• Full message stream
• Includes user, assistant, system, tool
• Includes Retry + Clear controls
• Renders consent actions

Architectural law:

Chat is a filtered projection of Transcript.
Transcript is the complete system log.
There is only one message store.

# 🟢 3️⃣ Layout & Dock Architecture

## 🔹 DockShell

File: src/layout/DockShell.jsx

DockShell now supports two explicit layout modes:

### Bottom Mode (default)

dockMode = "bottom"

• Main layout occupies screen
• Dock appears below
• Dock capped at max 55% viewport height
• Used when Focus OFF

### Full Surface Mode (Focus)

dockMode = "full"

• Dock replaces main layout
• Occupies full height under top bar
• No height cap
• No 50/50 split
• Used when Focus ON

Architectural principle:

Focus mode is a surface promotion, not a resized dock.

This eliminated:
• Height fighting
• Dock centering bugs
• Artificial max-height constraints

---

# 🔵 4️⃣ Tool Runtime Pipeline

## Tool Detection + Coordination

File: src/ai/panel/AiPanel.jsx

Responsible for:

• Parsing model tool requests
• Handling fenced tool/json/XML payloads
• Deduplication
• Triggering runtime execution
• Consent gating

---

## Tool Runtime Wrapper

File: src/ai/tools/toolRuntime.js

Responsible for:

• Consent enforcement
• Lifecycle messaging
• Transcript-visible tool events
• Success/error formatting

---

## Tool Handlers

File: src/ai/tools/handlers/index.js

Maps tool name → implementation.

Filesystem authority lives in:

src/lib/fs.js

App.js sets project root.
fs.js enforces path safety.

---

# 🟡 5️⃣ UI Philosophy (Locked)

KForge is not:

A debug console with chat attached.

KForge is:

A reasoning-first, calm coding surface.

Principles:

• Chat is primary
• Tools are explicit
• Diagnostics are optional
• Errors summarized in human language first
• Raw data available on demand
• No hidden side effects

Power-user controls must be:
• Optional
• Collapsible
• Never intrusive

---

# 🟠 6️⃣ Focus Mode Intent

Focus Mode exists to:

• Remove distraction
• Promote AI surface
• Preserve editor integrity

Focus Mode does NOT:
• Change AI behavior
• Create a new chat mode
• Duplicate message logic

It only changes layout.

---

# 🟣 7️⃣ Provider Strategy (Locked)

KForge supports:

• Cloud LLMs
• OpenAI-compatible endpoints
• Local runtimes (Ollama etc.)

Model IDs:

• User-editable
• Case-sensitive
• Sent exactly as provider expects
• Cost tags are metadata only

No friendly renaming at runtime layer.

---

# 🔴 8️⃣ Backup & Safety Discipline

KForge enforces multi-layer backup:

• Local git
• Remote GitHub
• Periodic zip snapshots
• External storage backup

Risky refactors must always be reversible.

---

# ⚖ 9️⃣ Operational Laws

• One objective per chat
• Major milestone → new chat
• Revert before hacking deeper
• Prefer clarity over cleverness
• Full-file edits preferred for core files
• Temporary code must be removed
• Architecture changes must update Project Map + Snapshot

---

# 🧠 10️⃣ Current Stability State

As of Phase 4.2i:

• Single-surface GPT UI stable
• Assistant-only chat projection working
• Transcript view stable
• DockShell dual-mode working
• Focus mode full-height surface working
• No duplicate rendering paths
• No split dock logic

This is a restore-grade architecture checkpoint.

# 🧭 When To Update This File

Update when:

• Dock behavior changes
• Message flow changes
• Tool runtime changes
• Provider architecture changes
• Layout authority shifts
• UI philosophy evolves

This file documents architectural truth.
